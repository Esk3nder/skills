# Critique Workflow

> **Trigger:** "design critique", "UX evaluation", "design feedback"
> **Input:** Interface, mockup, or screenshot to critique
> **Output:** Design director-style feedback with prioritized issues

Think like a design director giving feedback—holistic, opinionated, actionable.

## Step 1: AI Slop Detection (CRITICAL)

**This is the most important check.**

Does this look like every other AI-generated interface from 2024-2025?

Review against ALL DON'T guidelines:
- AI color palette (cyan-on-dark, purple gradients, neon accents)
- Gradient text, glassmorphism, hero metric layouts
- Identical card grids, nested cards
- Generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Open Sans)
- Bounce/elastic easing

**The test**: If you showed this to someone and said "AI made this," would they believe you immediately?

## Step 2: Evaluate Design Dimensions

### Visual Hierarchy
- Does the eye flow to the most important element first?
- Is there a clear primary action? Can you spot it in 2 seconds?
- Do size, color, and position communicate importance correctly?
- Is there visual competition between elements?

### Information Architecture
- Is the structure intuitive?
- Is related content grouped logically?
- Are there too many choices at once? (cognitive overload)
- Is navigation clear and predictable?

### Emotional Resonance
- What emotion does this interface evoke? Is that intentional?
- Does it match the brand personality?
- Would the target user feel "this is for me"?

### Discoverability & Affordance
- Are interactive elements obviously interactive?
- Would a user know what to do without instructions?
- Are hover/focus states providing useful feedback?

### Composition & Balance
- Does the layout feel balanced or uncomfortably weighted?
- Is whitespace used intentionally or just leftover?
- Is there visual rhythm in spacing and repetition?
- Does asymmetry feel designed or accidental?

### Typography as Communication
- Does the type hierarchy clearly signal what to read first?
- Is body text comfortable to read?
- Do font choices reinforce the brand/tone?

### Color with Purpose
- Is color used to communicate, not just decorate?
- Does the palette feel cohesive?
- Are accent colors drawing attention to the right things?

### States & Edge Cases
- Empty states: Do they guide users toward action?
- Loading states: Do they reduce perceived wait time?
- Error states: Are they helpful and non-blaming?

### Microcopy & Voice
- Is the writing clear and concise?
- Are labels and buttons unambiguous?

## Step 3: Generate Critique Report

### Anti-Patterns Verdict
**Start here.** Pass/fail on AI slop detection. List specific tells.

### Overall Impression
Brief gut reaction—what works, what doesn't, the single biggest opportunity.

### What's Working
2-3 things done well. Be specific about why they work.

### Priority Issues
The 3-5 most impactful design problems, ordered by importance:

For each issue:
- **What**: Name the problem clearly
- **Why it matters**: How this hurts users or undermines goals
- **Fix**: What to do about it (be concrete)

### Minor Observations
Quick notes on smaller issues worth addressing.

### Questions to Consider
Provocative questions that might unlock better solutions:
- "What if the primary action were more prominent?"
- "Does this need to feel this complex?"
- "What would a confident version of this look like?"

## Completion

Deliver critique with:
1. Anti-patterns verdict (pass/fail)
2. Overall impression
3. What's working (2-3 items)
4. Priority issues (3-5 items with fixes)
5. Questions to consider

**Remember**:
- Be direct—vague feedback wastes time
- Be specific—"the submit button" not "some elements"
- Say what's wrong AND why it matters
- Prioritize ruthlessly
- Don't soften criticism—honest feedback ships great design
