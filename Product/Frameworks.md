# Product Frameworks Quick Reference

A curated collection of frameworks from Lenny's Podcast guests and modern product practice.

---

## 1. DHM Model (Gibson Biddle, Netflix)

**Purpose:** Evaluate features against three criteria

| Element | Question | Score 1-5 |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Delight** | Does this make customers 10X happier? | |
| **Hard-to-Copy** | Can competitors replicate this quickly? | |
| **Margin** | Does this build or protect the business? | |

**Usage:** Every feature should score well on at least 2/3.

> "The hardest part is balancing delight versus margin."

---

## 2. Opportunity Solution Tree (Teresa Torres)

**Purpose:** Navigate from outcome to solution systematically

```
Outcome (root)
    └── Opportunities (branches)
            └── Solutions (leaves)
                    └── Assumption Tests
```

**Steps:**
1. Start with desired OUTCOME (not feature)
2. Identify OPPORTUNITIES (user problems/needs)
3. Generate SOLUTIONS (multiple per opportunity)
4. Test ASSUMPTIONS (validate before building)

> "Work with three ideas at once... compare and contrast at week's end."

## 3. Pre-Mortem (Shreyas Doshi)

**Purpose:** Surface risks before they materialize

| Category | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Tiger** | Threat that will actually kill us | Mitigate now |
| **Paper Tiger** | Seeming threat we're not worried about | Document why |
| **Elephant** | Thing nobody is talking about | Surface and discuss |

**When:** Before finalizing any PRD or major decision.

> "Gives psychological safety to bring up concerns."

---

## 4. Dinosaur Brain Principle (Ami Vora, WhatsApp)

**Purpose:** Communicate effectively with executives

**Rules:**
1. **Make a recommendation** - Don't just present information
2. **Minimize information** - Only what's needed for the decision
3. **Be opinionated** - Don't hide behind analyses
4. **Seek principles** - Get frameworks for future decisions

> "Executives have a tiny dinosaur brain. They can only hold three facts."

---

## 5. 4W1H Framework

**Purpose:** Ensure complete problem understanding

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Who** | Target users and personas |
| **What** | Feature/product being built |
| **When** | Timeline and milestones |
| **Where** | Context of use, platforms |
| **How** | Success metrics and measurement |

**Usage:** If you can answer all 5, your PRD is 80% done.

---

## 6. Inner/Outer Scorecard (Ada Chen Rekhi)

**Purpose:** Balance external metrics with internal values

| Outer Scorecard | Inner Scorecard |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Revenue | User trust |
| User count | Quality |
| Market share | Team culture |
| Valuation | Kindness |

> "Did you win at the cost of kindness?"

**Usage:** Consider both when evaluating trade-offs.

---

## 7. Spec-Driven Development (GitHub Spec Kit)

**Purpose:** Generate implementation from specifications for AI agents

**Phases:**
1. **Specify** - Goals and user journeys
2. **Plan** - Architecture and constraints
3. **Tasks** - Small, reviewable units
4. **Implement** - AI agent execution

**Key Pattern:** "DO NOT CHANGE" sections protect existing functionality.

> "Intent is the source of truth, not code."

---

## 8. Strategy Components (Jackie Bavaro, Asana)

**Purpose:** Align PRDs to product strategy

**Three Parts:**
1. **Vision** - Inspirational future state (5-10 years)
2. **Strategic Framework** - Market, success criteria, big bets
3. **Roadmap** - Feasibility check (not commitment)

> "Roadmaps reveal if your vision is 5 years away or 30."

---

## 9. Continuous Discovery Habits (Teresa Torres)

**Purpose:** Integrate discovery into daily work

**Principles:**
- Weekly customer interviews (not project-based)
- Test assumptions, not ideas
- Behavior over opinion in interviews
- Compare 3 solutions simultaneously

**Velocity Target:** 6-12 assumption tests per week

> "If you don't have time for discovery, you don't have time for project-based research."

---

## 10. "Yes, And..." (Adam Grenier, Uber)

**Purpose:** Build alignment across teams

**Pattern:**
- Accept others' goals as valid
- Add your perspective without negating
- Build on shared understanding

**Anti-pattern:**
> "No, you're wrong. That's not important." — Kills progress and relationships.

**Usage:** Stakeholder conflicts, cross-functional alignment.

---

## 11. Levels of Thinking (Shreyas Doshi)

**Purpose:** Diagnose the real problem level

| Level | Focus | Timeframe |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Execution** | Tasks and delivery | Days/weeks |
| **Strategy** | Direction and priorities | Months/quarters |
| **Optics** | Perception and politics | Ongoing |

> "What looks like execution problems are usually strategy problems."

**Usage:** Before writing a PRD, ensure strategic clarity exists.

---

## 12. Behavior Over Opinion (Teresa Torres)

**Purpose:** Get reliable user insights

**Unreliable Questions:**
- "Would you use this?"
- "What do you think about X?"
- "Why do you do Y?"

**Reliable Questions:**
- "Tell me about the last time you..."
- "What did you actually do?"
- "Walk me through your process..."

> "People are terrible at predicting their own behavior."
